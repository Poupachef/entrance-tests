# Poupachef

## Job opportunity

Here at Poupachef we are designing the future of food procurement - and we strongly believe that this task goes by empowering small restaurant owners and scanning the current food service environment.

After testing the market and raising fund with a top notch investor, we are now looking for extremely talented developers, hungry for knowledge and willing to join our journey. There are currently two open job positions: (i) mobile developer; and (ii) data scientist.

### Benefits

 - Competitive salary
 - Possibility of variable $ or stock options based on performance
 - Be an early employee, with huge freedom, in a promising startup
 - Contact with recent technologies such as *serverless*, *golang*, *kotlin* and *react*

### Mobile developer

As a mobile developer at Poupachef, you will work with the team of developers to build our Android and iOS apps. We are looking for someone who is interested in not only the development itself, but everything that makes up the app, from automation scripts and testing to UX/UI and analytics.

**Requirements:**
- Extensive knowledge in HTML, CSS and vanilla JS;
- Experience developing mobiles apps using React Native;
- Experience using Git and build tools, such as Yarn and Webpack;
- Experience with REST APIs;
- Curiosity about emerging technologies and trends;

**Nice to have:**
- A published app;
- Experience publishing an app to Google or App store;
- Experience with any testing library;
- UX/UI skills;

### Data scientist

The data scientist position involves, but is not limited to, upgrading our precious pricing algorithm - written in Python 3.7 - and our price mining and import routines, such as our serverless function that loads new data into the database. The job also includes creating and monitoring web crawlers that collect the information of food ingredient’s public prices, which will then be used to feed Poupachef’s internal pricing algorithm.

**Requirements:** Python

## Coding tests

Choose 2 of the following 3 problems and send the answers by email to [devs](mailto:devs@poupachef.com.br). The tests can be  solved in any programming language.

### 1

UTF-8 is a variable leght character encoding that maps each symbol to one, two, three, or four bytes. The rules for mapping characters are as follows:

- For a single-byte character, the first bit must be zero.
- For an n-byte character, the first byte starts with n ones and a zero. The other n - 1 bytes all start with 10.

Visually, this can be represented as follows.

```
 Bytes   |           Byte format
-----------------------------------------------
   1     | 0xxxxxxx
   2     | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   3     | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   4     | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
```

Write a program that takes in an array of integers representing byte values, and returns whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

---

### 2

Implement the function fib(n), which returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence, using only O(1) space.

---

### 3

Spreadsheets often use this alphabetical encoding for its columns: "A", "B", "C", ..., "AA", "AB", ..., "ZZ", "AAA", "AAB", ....

Given a column number, return its alphabetical column id. For example, given 1, return "A". Given 27, return "AA".

### Good luck
