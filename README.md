## Entrance tests

### Front-end
Create a single HTML and CSS file with the following features:
- Header with the Poupachef logo (can be found in the front-end folder);
- Side menu that slides in and out of frame when pressing a button (try using CSS only);
- A table with at least 4 columns, using data from any open API (we recommend the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/documentation));

You are allowed to use any library for HTTP requests and DOM manipulation, such as **JQuery** or **Axios**.

You are **not** allowed to use a CSS framework (Bootstrap, Materialize, etc...).

### Back-end
The test is simple and it's inside the back-end folder. Good luck!
